This guide explains how you can embed {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] into your own Java programs and in how you can extend it so that Asciidoctor matches all your needs for a publishing chain.
This guide assumes that you have a basic knowledge about the {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] format.

== Introduction

Asciidoctor is an implementation of the AsciiDoc format in Ruby.
Thanks to the {uri-jruby}[JRuby], an implementation of the Ruby runtime in Java, Asciidoctor can also be executed on a JVM.
{uri-repo}[AsciidoctorJ] bundles all gems that are required for executing Asciidoctor and wraps it into a Java API so that Asciidoctor can be used in Java like any other Java library.
Additionally there is a distribution that you can simply download, unzip and execute without worrying about installing the right Ruby runtime, installing gems etc.

This guide will not go into details of the distribution.
Instead you will learn how you can embed and leverage Asciidoctor by embedding it into your own code.

The following sections will show:

- how to render AsciiDoc content to HTML via AsciidoctorJ
- how you can extend AsciidoctorJ to extend the AsciiDoc format and modify the way documents are rendered
- how you can write a converter for your own custom target format
- how you can capture Asciidoctor messages to monitor the rendering process

== Integrate AsciidoctorJ: Render documents via the API

This section shows you how you can use AsciidoctorJ to render AsciiDoc documents to HTML from within your own code.
An introductory example shows the first steps necessary.
The rest of this section will show what options you can use to influence the way Asciidoctor renders your documents.

=== First steps: Rendering a document

The very first step to integrate AsciidoctorJ is to add the required dependencies to your project.
Depending on your build system you have to add a dependency on the artifact `asciidoctorj` with the group id `org.asciidoctor` to your build file.
The following snippets show what you have to add in case you use Maven, Gradle, Ivy or SBT.

[source,xml]
[subs="specialcharacters,attributes,callouts"]
.Declaring the dependency in a Maven build file (i.e., pom.xml)
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
    <artifactId>asciidoctorj</artifactId>
    <version>{artifact-version}</version> <!--1-->
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[source,groovy]
[subs="specialcharacters,attributes,callouts"]
.Declaring the dependency in a Gradle build file (e.g., build.gradle)
----
dependencies {
  compile 'org.asciidoctor:asciidoctorj:{artifact-version}' // <1>
}
----

[source,xml]
[subs="specialcharacters,attributes,callouts"]
.Declaring the dependency in an Ivy dependency descriptor (e.g., ivy.xml)
----
<dependency org="org.asciidoctor" name="asciidoctorj" rev="{artifact-version}" /> <!--1-->
----

[source,scala]
[subs="specialcharacters,attributes,callouts"]
.Declaring the dependency in an SBT build file (e.g., build.sbt)
----
libraryDependencies += "org.asciidoctor" % "asciidoctorj" % "{artifact-version}" // <1>
----
<1> Specifying the version of AsciidoctorJ implicitly selects the version of Asciidoctor

The dependency on AsciidoctorJ will transitively add a dependency on the module `jruby-complete` with the group id `org.jruby`.


The following Java program shows how to convert an arbitrary AsciiDoc file to an HTML file.
AsciidoctorJ will already fully embedded in your Java program and it looks like any other Java library, so there is no need to fear Ruby.
If you execute the following Java program and have an AsciiDoc file `document.adoc` in your current working directory you should see the rendered result `document.html` afterwards next to your original document.

[source,java]
.Converting an AsciiDoc file to an HTML file
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/SimpleAsciidoctorRendering.java[]
----
<1> The static method `Asciidoctor.Factory.create()` creates a new Asciidoctor instance.
    This is the door to all interactions with Asciidoctor.
<2> The method `convertFile` takes a `File` and conversion options.
    Depending on the options it will create a new file or return the rendered content.
    In this case a new file is created and the method returns `null`.
<3> The conversion options define via `toFile(true)` that the result should be written to a new file.
    The option `safe` imposes security constraints on the rendering process.
    `safe(SafeMode.UNSAFE)` defines the least restricting constraints and allows for example inserting the beautiful `asciidoctor.css` stylesheet into the resulting document.

=== The Asciidoctor interface

The main entry point for AsciidoctorJ is the `Asciidoctor` Java interface.
You obtain an instance from the factory class `Asciidoctor.Factory` that provides multiple overloaded create methods:

.Methods to create an Asciidoctor instance
[cols="1m,2"]
|===
|Method Name | Description

| create()
| The default create method that is used most often.
  Only use other methods if you want to load extensions that are not on the classpath.

| create(String gemPath)
| Creates a new Asciidoctor instance and sets the global variable `GEM_PATH` to the given String.
  The variable `GEM_PATH` defines where Ruby looks for installed gems.

| create(List<String> loadPaths)
| Creates a new Asciidoctor instance and set the global variable `LOAD_PATH` to the given Strings.
  The variable `LOAD_PATH` defines where Ruby looks for files.

|===

So most of the time you simply get an Asciidoctor instance like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
.Default way to create an Asciidoctor instance
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/AsciidoctorInterface.java[tags=create]
----

As Asciidoctor instances can be created they can also be explicitly destroyed to free resources used in particular by the Ruby runtime associated with it.
Therefore the Asciidoctor interface offers the method destroy.
After calling this method every other method call on the instance will fail!

[source,java,indent=0]
.Destroying an Asciidoctor instance
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/AsciidoctorInterface.java[tags=shutdown]
----

To convert AsciiDoc documents the Asciidoctor interface provides four methods:

* `convert`
* `convertFile`
* `convertFiles`
* `convertDirectory`

IMPORTANT: Prior to Asciidoctor 1.5.0, the term `render` was used in these method names instead of `convert` (i.e., `render`, `renderFile`, `renderFiles` and `renderDirectory`).
AsciidoctorJ continues to support the old method names for backwards compatibility.

[cols="1m,1m,2"]
.Convert methods on the `Asciidoctor` interface
|===
|Method Name |Return Type| Description

|convert
|String
|Parses AsciiDoc content read from a string or stream and converts it to the format specified by the `backend` option.

|convertFile
|String
|Parses AsciiDoc content read from a file and converts it to the format specified by the `backend` option.

|convertFiles
|String[]
|Parses a collection of AsciiDoc files and converts them to the format specified by the `backend` option.

|convertDirectory
|String[]
|Parses all AsciiDoc files found in the specified directory (using the provided strategy) and converts them to the format specified by the `backend` option.
|===

// What is the 'provided strategy', need a link

Here's an example of using AsciidoctorJ to convert an AsciiDoc string.

[NOTE]
The following `convertFile` or `convertFiles` methods will only return a converted `String` object or array if you disable writing to a file, which is enabled by default.
You will learn more about the conversion options in <<options>>
To disable writing to a file, create a new `Options` object, disable the option to create a new file with `option.setToFile(false)`, and then pass the object as a parameter to `convertFile` or `convertFiles`.

[source]
.Converting an AsciiDoc string
----
String html = asciidoctor.convert(
    "Writing AsciiDoc is _easy_!",
    new HashMap<String, Object>());
System.out.println(html);
----

The `convertFile` method will convert the contents of an AsciiDoc file.

[source]
.Converting an AsciiDoc file
----
String html = asciidoctor.convertFile(
    new File("sample.adoc"),
    new HashMap<String, Object>());
System.out.println(html);
----

The `convertFiles` method will convert a collection of AsciiDoc files:

[source]
.Converting a collection of AsciiDoc files
----
String[] result = asciidoctor.convertFiles(
    Arrays.asList(new File("sample.adoc")),
    new HashMap<String, Object>());

for (String html : result) {
    System.out.println(html);
}
----

WARNING: If the converted content is written to files, the `convertFiles` method will return a String Array (i.e., `String[]`) with the names of all the converted documents.

Another method provided by the `Asciidoctor` interface is `convertDirectory`.
This method converts all of the files with AsciiDoc extensions (`.adoc` _(preferred)_, `.ad`, `.asciidoc`, `.asc`) that are present within a specified folder and following given strategy.

An instance of the `DirectoryWalker` interface, which provides a strategy for locating files to process, must be passed as the first parameter of the `convertDirectory` method.
Currently `Asciidoctor` provides two built-in implementations of the `DirectoryWalker` interface:

[cols="1m,2"]
.Built-in `DirectoryWalker` implementations
|===
|Class |Description

|AsciiDocDirectoryWalker
|Converts all files of given folder and all its subfolders. Ignores files starting with underscore (_).

|GlobDirectoryWalker
|Converts all files of given folder following a glob expression.
|===

If the converted content is not written into files, `convertDirectory` will return an array listing all the documents converted.

// SW: Maybe provide an example of this array output?

[source]
.Converting all AsciiDoc files in a directory
----
String[] result = asciidoctor.convertDirectory(
    new AsciiDocDirectoryWalker("src/asciidoc"),
    new HashMap<String, Object>());

for (String html : result) {
    System.out.println(html);
}
----

[[options]]
=== Conversion options

Asciidoctor provides many options that can be passed when converting content.
This section explains these options as they might be important when converting Asciidoctor content yourself.

The options for conversion of a document are held in an instance of the class `org.asciidoctor.Options`.
A builder allows for simple configuration of that instance that can be passed to the respective method of the `Asciidoctor` interface.
The following example shows how to set the options so that the resulting HTML document is rendered for embedding it into another document.
That means that the result only contains the content of a HTML body element:

[source]
.Example for converting to an embeddable document
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/OptionsTest.java[tags=simpleOptionsExampleEmbeddableDocument]
----
<1> Create a new `OptionsBuilder` that is used to prepare the options with a fluent API.
<2> Set the option `header_footer` to `false`, meaning that an embeddable document will be rendered,
<3> Get the built `Options` instance and pass it to the conversion method.

The most important options are explained below.

==== toFile

Via the option `toFile` it is possible to define if a document should be written to a file at all and to which file.

To make the API return the converted document and not write to a file set `OptionsBuilder.toFile(false)`.

To make Asciidoctor write to the default file set `OptionsBuilder.toFile(true)`.
The default file is computed by taking the base name of the input file and adding the default suffix for the target format like `.html` or `.pdf`.
That is for the input file `test.adoc` the resulting file would be in the same directory with the name `test.html`. +
*This is also the way the CLI behaves.*

To write to a certain file set `OptionsBuilder.toFile(targetFile)`.
This is also necessary if you want to convert string content to files.

The following example shows how to convert content to a dedicated file:

[source]
.Example for converting to a dedicated file
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/OptionsTest.java[tags=optionToFile]
----
<1> Set the option `toFile` so that the result will be written to the file pointed to by `targetFile`.
<2> Set the safe mode to `UNSAFE` so that files can be written.
    See <<safemode>> for a description of this option.

[[safemode]]
==== safe

Asciidoctor provides security levels that control the read and write access of attributes, the include directive, macros, and scripts while a document is processing.
Each level includes the restrictions enabled in the prior security level.
All safe modes are defined by the enum `org.asciidoctor.SafeMode`.
The safe modes in order from most insecure to most secure are:

`UNSAFE`::
A safe mode level that disables any security features enforced by Asciidoctor. 
+
*This is the default safe mode for the CLI.*

`SAFE`::
This safe mode level prevents access to files which reside outside of the parent directory of the source file. 
It disables all macros, except the include directive. 
The paths to include files must be within the parent directory. 
It allows assets to be embedded in the document.

`SERVER`::
A safe mode level that disallows the document from setting attributes that would affect the rendering of the document.
This level trims the attribute `docfile` to its relative path and prevents the document from:
+
--
* setting +source-highlighter+, +doctype+, +docinfo+ and +backend+
* seeing +docdir+

It allows +icons+ and +linkcss+.
-- 

`SECURE`::
A safe mode level that disallows the document from attempting to read files from the file system and including their contents into the document.
Additionally, it:
+
--
* disables icons
* disables the `include` directive
* data can not be retrieved from URIs
* prevents access to stylesheets and JavaScripts
* sets the backend to `html5`
* disables `docinfo` files
* disables `data-uri`
* disables `docdir` and `docfile`
* disables source highlighting

Asciidoctor extensions may still embed content into the document depending whether they honor the safe mode setting.

*This is the default safe mode for the API.* 
--

So if you want to render documents in the same way as the CLI does you have to set the safe mode to `Unsafe`.
Without it you will for example not get the stylesheet embedded into the resulting document.

[source]
.Convert a document in unsafe mode
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/OptionsTest.java[tags=unsafeConversion]
----
<1> Sets the safe mode from `SECURE` to `UNSAFE`.
<2> Don't convert the file to another file but to a string so that we can easier verify the contents.


The example above will succeed with these two asciidoc files:

[source,asciidoctor]
.includingcontent.adoc
--
  = Including content

  include::includedcontent.adoc[]
--

[source,asciidoctor]
.includedcontent.adoc
--
  This is included content
--

==== backend

This option defines the target format for which the document should be converted.
Among the possible values are `pdf` or `docbook`.

[source,indent=0]
.Render a document to PDF
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/OptionsTest.java[tags=optionsPDFBackend]
----

==== attributes

This option allows to define document attributes externally.
Attributes are defined just like options, but using the `AttributesBuilder` to build instance of it.
For many attributes used by Asciidoctor there are predefined methods.
The method `AttributesBuilder.attribute(key, value)` allows for defining arbitrary attributes.

To enable the use of font-awesome icons the attribute `icons` has to be set to the value `font` in the document.
From the API this is done like this:

[source,indent=0]
.Enable use of font-awesome icons
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/OptionsTest.java[tags=attributeFontIcons]
----
<1> Create a builder for attributes and pass the resulting `Attributes` instance to the options.
<2> Define the attribute supported by Asciidoctor to use the font awesome icons.
<3> Define the custom attribute `foo` to the value `bar`.

=== Ruby runtime

Asciidoctor itself is implemented in Ruby and AsciidoctorJ is a wrapper that encapsulates Asciidoctor in a JRuby runtime.
Even though AsciidoctorJ tries to hide as much as possible there are some points that you have to know and consider when using AsciidoctorJ.

Every Asciidoctor instance uses and initializes its own Ruby runtime.
As booting a Ruby runtime takes a considerable amount of time it is wise to either use a single instance or pool multiple instances in case your program wants to render multiple documents instead of creating one Asciidoctor instance per conversion.
Asciidoctor itself is threadsafe, so from this point of view there is no issue in starting only one instance.

The JRuby runtime can be configured in numerous ways to change the behavior as well as the performance.
As the performance requirements vary between a program that only render a single document and quit and server application that run for a long time you should consider modifying these options for your own use case.
AsciidoctorJ itself does not make any configurations so that you can modify like you think.
A full overview of the options is available at https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/ConfiguringJRuby.

To change the configuration of the JRuby instance you have to set the corresponding options as system properties before creating the Asciidoctor instance.

So to create an Asciidoctor instance for single use that does not try to JIT compile the Ruby code the option `compile.mode` should be set to `OFF`.
That means that you have to set the system property `jruby.compile.mode` to `OFF`:

[source,java]
.Create an Asciidoctor instance for single use
----
System.setProperty("jruby.compile.mode", "OFF");
Asciidoctor asciidoctor = Asciidoctor.Factory.create();
----

The default for this value is `JIT` which is already a reasonable value for multiple uses of the Asciidoctor instance.

In case you want to have direct access to the Ruby runtime instance that is used by a certain Asciidoctor instance you can use the class `JRubyRuntimeContext` to obtain the `org.jruby.Ruby` instance:

[source,java]
.Obtaining the Ruby instance associated with an Asciidoctor instance
----
Asciidoctor asciidoctor = Asciidoctor.Factory.create();
Ruby ruby = JRubyRuntimeContext.get(asciidoctor);
----

== Extend AsciidoctorJ: Write your own extensions

One of the major improvements to Asciidoctor recently is the extensions API.
AsciidoctorJ brings this extension API to the JVM environment.
{uri-repo}[AsciidoctorJ] allows us to write extensions in Java instead of Ruby.

Asciidoctor provides seven types of extension points.
Each extension point has an abstract class in Java that maps to the extension API in Ruby.

// #31

[cols="1m,2m,2"]
.AsciidoctorJ extension APIs

|===

[NOTE]
--
.Order of execution
The extension types are called during the conversion process in the order shown in the table.
Within each type:

* Include processors are called in an arbitrary and changeable order. 
The first processor to accept the include line is the only one that is used.

* Block macro, inline macro, and block processors are called in the order that they appear in the document.

* Prepocessors, Treeprocessors, Postprocessors and DocinfoProcessors are called in an arbitrary and changeable order.
--

To create an extension two things are required:

. Create a class extending one of the extension classes from above
. Register your class using the `JavaExtensionRegistry` class

But before starting to write your first extension it is essential to understand how Asciidoctor treats the document:
The raw text content is parsed into a tree structure which is then transformed into the target format.
Therefore this section first goes into the details of this tree structure before explaining what extensions are possible and how to implement them.

=== Understanding the AST classes

To write extensions or converters for AsciidoctorJ understanding the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) classes is key.
The AST classes are the intermediate representation of the document that Asciidoctor creates before rendering to the target format.

The following example document demonstrates how an AST will look like to give you an idea how the document and the AST are connected.

.Example document for the AST
[source]
--
include::src/test/resources/ast-demo.adoc[]
--

The following image shows the AST and some selected members of the node objects.
The indentation of a line visualizes the nesting of the nodes like a tree.

.AST for the example document
----
include::src/test/resources/ast-demo-result.txt[]
----

The AST is built from the following types:

`org.asciidoctor.ast.Document`::
  This is always the root of the document.
  It owns the blocks and sections that make up the document and holds the document attributes.

`org.asciidoctor.ast.Section`::
  This class model sections in the document.
  The member level indicates the nesting level of this section, that is if level is 1 the section is a section, with level 2 it is a subsection etc.

`org.asciidoctor.ast.Block`::
  Blocks are content in a section, like paragraphs, source listings, images, etc.
  The concrete form of the block is available in the field `context`.
  Among the possible values are:
  .. `paragraph`
  .. `listing`
  .. `literal`
  .. `open`
  .. `example`
  .. `pass`

`org.asciidoctor.ast.List`::
  The list node is the container for ordered and unordered lists.
  The type of list is available in the field `context`, with the content `ulist` for unordered lists, `olist` for ordered lists.

`org.asciidoctor.ast.ListItem`::
  A list item represents a single item of a list.

`org.asciidoctor.ast.DescriptionList`::
  The description list node is the container for description lists.
  The context of the node is `dlist`.

`org.asciidoctor.ast.DescriptionListEntry`::
  A list entry represents a single item of a description list.
  It has multiple terms that are again instances of `org.asciidoctor.ast.ListItem` and a description that is also an instance of `org.asciidoctor.ast.ListItem`.

`org.asciidoctor.ast.Table`::
  This represents a table and is probably the most complex node type.
  It owns a list of columns and lists of header, body and footer rows.

`org.asciidoctor.ast.Column`::
  A column defines the style for the column of a table, the width and alignments.
  
`org.asciidoctor.ast.Row`::
  A row in a table is only a simple owner of a list of table cells.

`org.asciidoctor.ast.Cell`::
  A cell in a table holds the cell content and formatting attributes like colspan, rowspan and alignment as appropriate.
  A special case are cells that have the `asciidoctor` style.
  These do not contain simple text content, but have another full `Document` in their member `innerDocument`.
  
`org.asciidoctor.ast.PhraseNode`::
  This type is a special case.
  It does not appear in the AST itself as Asciidoctor does not really parse into the block itself.
  Phrase nodes are usually created by inline macro extensions that process macros like `issue:1234[]` and create links from them.

Nodes are in general only created from within extensions.
Therefore the abstract base class of all extensions, `org.asciidoctor.extension.Processor`, has factory methods for every node type.

Now that you have learned about the AST structure you can go into the details of the extensions.

[[blockmacroprocessor]]
=== Block Macro Processors

A block macro is a block having a content like this: `gist::mygithubaccount/8810011364687d7bec2c[]`.
During the rendering process of the document Asciidoctor invokes a BlockMacroProcessor that has to create a block computed from this macro.

The structure is always like this:

. Macro name, e.g. `gist`
. Two colons `::`
. A target, `mygithubaccount/8810011364687d7bec2c`
. Attributes, that are empty in this case, `[]`

Our example block macro should embed the GitHub gist that would be available at the URL https://gist.github.com/mygithubaccount/8810011364687d7bec2c.

The following block macro processor replaces such a macro with the `<script>` element that you can also pick from https://gist.github.com for a certain gist.

[[GistBlockMacroProcessor]]
.A BlockMacroProcessor that replaces gist block macros
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/GistBlockMacroProcessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The `@Name` annotation defines the macro name this BlockMacroProcessor should be called for.
    In this case this instance will be called for all block macros that have the name `gist`.
<2> All BlockMacroProcessors must extend the class `org.asciidoctor.extension.BlockMacroProcessor`.
<3> A BlockMacroProcessor must implement the abstract method `process` that is called by Asciidoctor.
    The method must return a new block that is used be Asciidoctor instead of the block containing the block macro.
<4> The implementation constructs the HTML content that should go into the final HTML document.
    That means that the content has to be directly passed through into the result.
    Having said that this example does not work when generating PDF content.
<5> The processor creates a new block via the inherited method `createBlock()`.
    The parent of the new block, a context and the content must be passed.
    As we want to pass through the content directly into the result the context must be `pass` and the content is the computed HTML string.

NOTE: There are many more methods available to create any type of AST node.

Now we want to make this block macro processor work on the block macro in our document:

[[GistBlockMacroDocument]]
.gist-macro.adoc
----
include::src/test/resources/gist-macro.adoc[]
----

To make AsciidoctorJ use our processor it has to be registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry`:

[[inlineprocessor]]
=== Inline Macro Processors

An inline macro is very similar to a block macro.
But instead of being replaced by a block created by a BlockMacroProcessor it is replaced by a phrase node that is simply a part of a block, e.g. in the middle of a sentence.
An example for an inline macro is `issue:333[repo=asciidoctor/asciidoctorj]`.

The structure is always like this:

. Macro name, e.g. `issue`
. One colon, i.e. `:`.
  This is what distinguishes it from a block macro even if it is alone in a paragraph.
. An optional target, e.g. `333`
. Optional attributes, e.g. `[repo=asciidoctor/asciidoctorj]`.

Our example inline macro processor should create a link to the issue #333 of the repository `asciidoctor/asciidoctorj` on GitHub.
If the attribute `repo` in the macro is empty it should fall back to the document attribute `repo`.

So for the following document our inline macro processor should create links to the issue #333 of the repository `asciidoctor/asciidoctorj` and to the issue #2 for the repository `asciidoctor/asciidoctorj-groovy-dsl`.

[[IssueInlineMacroDocument]]
.issue-inline-macro.adoc
----
include::src/test/resources/issue-inline-macro.adoc[]
----

The InlineMacroProcessor for these macros looks like this:

[[IssueInlineMacroProcessor]]
.An InlineMacroProcessor that replaces issue macros with links
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/IssueInlineMacroProcessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The `@Name` annotation defines the macro name this InlineMacroProcessor should be called for.
    In this case this instance will be called for all inline macros that have the name `issue`.
<2> All InlineMacroProcessors must extend the class `org.asciidoctor.extension.InlineMacroProcessor`.
<3> A InlineMacroProcessor must implement the abstract method `process` that is called by Asciidoctor.
    The method must return the rendered result of this macro.
<4> The implementation constructs and returns a new phrase node that is a link, i.e. an `anchor` via the method `createPhraseNode()`.
    The third parameter `target` defines that the text to render this link is the target of the macro, that means that the link will be rendered as  `333` or `2`.
    The last parameter, the options, must contain the target of the line, i.e. the referenced URL, and that the type of the anchor is a link.
    It could also be a ':xref', a ':ref', or a ':bibref'.

To make AsciidoctorJ use our processor it has to be registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry`:

[[TestIssueInlineMacroProcessor]]
.Register and execute a InlineMacroProcessor
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/IssueInlineMacroProcessorTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The inline macro processor is registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry` of the Asciidoctor instance.
<2> Check that the resulting HTML contains the two anchor elements.

The example above has shown how to create a link from a macro.
But there are several other things that an InlineMacroProcessor can create like icons, inline images etc.
Even though the following examples might not make much sense, they show how phrase nodes have to be created for the different use cases.

To create keyboard icons like kbd:[Ctrl+T] which can be created directly in Asciidoctor via `\kbd:[Ctrl+T]` you create the PhraseNode as shown below.
The example assumes that the macro is called with the macro name `ctrl` and a key as the target, e.g. `\ctrl:S[]`, and creates kbd:[Ctrl + S] from it.

[[KeyboardInlineMacroProcessor]]

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/KeyboardInlineMacroProcessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The attributes of the PhraseNode must contain the keys to be shown as a list for the attribute key `keys`.
<2> Create a PhraseNode with context `kbd` and no text and return it.

To create a menu selection as described at http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#menu-selections a processor would create a PhraseNode with the `menu` context.
The following processor would render the macro `rightclick:New|Class[]` like this: menu:New[Class].

[[ContextMenuInlineMacroProcessor]]

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/ContextMenuInlineMacroProcessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The attributes of the PhraseNode must contain the key `menu` referring to the first menu selection, `submenus` referring to a possibly empty list of submenu selections, and finally the key `menuitem` referring to the final menu item selection.
<2> Create and return an PhraseNode with context `menu` and no text.

To create an inline image the PhraseNode must have the context `image`.
The following example assumes that there is a site \http://foo.bar that serves images given as the target of the macro.
That means the MacroProcessor should replace the macro `foo:1234` to an image element that refers to \http://foo.bar/1234.


[[ImageInlineMacroProcessor]]
.Create a PhraseNode for inline image.
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/ImageInlineMacroProcessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> For an inline image the option `type` must have the value `image`.
<2> The URL of the image must be set via the option `target`.
<3> Optional attributes `alt` for alternative text, `width` and `height` are set in the node attributes.
    Other possible attributes include `title` to define the title attribute of the `img` element when rendering to HTML.
    When setting the attribute `link` to any value the node will be converted to a link to that image, where the window can be defined via the attribute `window`.
<4> Create and return a PhraseNode with context `image` and no text.

// #506

We said at the start of this section that the target (the x in `\menu:x[]`) is optional. 
If you want a macro that does not have a target (for example `cite:[brown79]`) add the following annotation to your class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Name("cite")
@Format(SHORT)
class CiteInlineMacroProcessor extends InlineMacroProcessor {
  ...
}
----

With the SHORT format, the attributes are not parsed, and the 'target' that is passed to your macro is the value between the brackets ("brown79").

[[blockprocessor]]
=== Block Processors

A block processor is very similar to a block macro processor.
But in contrast to a block macro a block processor is called for a block having a certain name instead of a macro invocation.
Therefore block processors rather transform blocks instead of creating them as block macro processors do.

The following example shows a block processor that converts the whole text of a block to upper case if it has the name `yell`.
That means that our block processor will convert blocks like this:

.yell-block.adoc
[source,asciidoctor]
----
include::src/test/resources/yell-block.adoc[]
----

After the processing this block will look like this

====
include::src/test/resources/yell-block-result.txt[]
====

The BlockProcessor looks like this:

.A BlockProcessor that transforms the content of a block to upper case
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/YellBlockProcessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The annotation `@Name` defines the block name that this block processor handles.
<2> The annotation `@Contexts` defines the block types that this block processor handles like paragraphs, listing blocks, or open blocks.
    Constants for all contexts are also defined in this annotation.
    Note that this annotation takes a list of block types, so that a block processor can process paragraph blocks as well as example blocks with the same block name.
<3> The annotation `@ContentModel` defines what this processor produces.
    Constants for all contexts are also defined for the annotation class.
    In this case the block processor creates a simple paragraph, therefore the content model `ContentModel.SIMPLE` is defined.
<4> All block processors must extend `org.asciidoctor.extension.BlockProcessor`.
<5> A block processor must implement the method `process()`.
    Here the implementation gets the raw block content from the reader, transforms it and creates and returns a new block that contains the transformed content.
    
To make AsciidoctorJ use our processor it also has to be registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/YellBlockProcessorTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The block processor is registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry` of the Asciidoctor instance.
<2> Check that the resulting HTML contains the text as upper-case letters.

[[includeprocessor]]
=== Include Processors

Asciidoctor supports include other documents via the include directive: You can simply write `include::other.adoc[]` to include the contents of the file `other.adoc`.
Include Processors allow to intercept this mechanism and for instance include the content over the network.
For example an Include Processor could resolve the include directive `include::ls[]` could insert the contents of the current directory.

Our example will replace the include directive `include::ls[]` with the directory contents of the current directory, one line for every file.
That is the document below will render a listing with the directory contents:

// Don't know how to include this file without asciidoctor trying to process include::ls[]
.ls-include.adoc
[source,indent=0]
----
  ----
  include::ls[]
  ----
----

The processor could look like this:

.LsIncludeProcessor.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/LsIncludeProcessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Every Include Processor must extend the class `org.asciidoctor.extension.IncludeProcessor`.
<2> Asciidoctor calls the method `handles()` with the target for every include directive it finds.
    The method must return `true` if it feels responsible for this directive.
    In our case it returns `true` if the target is `ls`.
<3> The implementation of the method `process()` lists the directory contents of the current directory and creates a string with one line per file.
<4> Finally the call to the method `push_include` inserts the contents.
    The second and third parameters contain the 'file name' of the include content.
    In our example this will be basically the name `ls` and the path of the current directory.
    The parameter `1` is the line number of the first line of the included content.
    This makes the most sense when partial content is included.

To make AsciidoctorJ use our processor it also has to be registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/LsIncludeProcessorTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The Include Processor is registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry` of the Asciidoctor instance.

[[preprocessor]]
=== Preprocessors

Preprocessors allow to process the raw asciidoctor sources before Asciidoctor parses and converts them.
A preprocessor could for example make comments visible that should be rendered in drafts.

Our example preprocessor does exactly that and will render the comment in the following document as a note.

.comment.adoc
[source,asciidoctor]
----
include::src/test/resources/comment.adoc[]
----

The preprocessor will render the document as if it looked like this:

.comment-with-note.adoc
[source,asciidoctor]
----
include::src/test/resources/comment-with-note.adoc[]
----

The implementation of the preprocessor simply gets the AST node for the document to be created as well as a `PreprocessorReader`.
A `PreprocessorReader` gives access to the raw input line by line allowing to fetch and restore content.
And this is exactly what our Preprocessor does: it fetches the raw content, modifies it and stores it back so that Asciidoctor will only see our modified content.

.A Preprocessor that renders comments as notes
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/CommentPreprocessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> All Preprocessors must extend the class `org.asciidoctor.extension.Preprocessor` and implement the method `process()`.
<2> The implementation gets the whole Asciidoctor source as an array of Strings where each entry corresponds to one line.
<3> Every odd occurrence of a comment start is replaced by opening an admonition block, every even occurrence is closing it.
    The new content is collected in a new list.
<4> The processed content is restored to the original `PreprocessorReader` so that it replaces the content that was already consumed at the beginning of the method.

To make AsciidoctorJ use our processor it also has to be registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/CommentPreprocessorTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The preprocessor is registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry` of the Asciidoctor instance.
<2> Check that the resulting HTML is the same as if a document with an admonition block would have been rendered.

There may be multiple Preprocessors registered and every Preprocessor will be called.
But the order in which the Preprocessors are called is undefined so that all Preprocessors should be independent of each other.

[[postprocessor]]
=== Postprocessors

Postprocessors are called when Asciidoctor has converted the document to its target format and have the chance to modify the result.
A Postprocessor could for example insert a custom copyright notice into the footer element of the resulting HTML document.

[NOTE]
Postprocessors in AsciidoctorJ currently only supports String based target formats.
That means it is not possible at the moment to write Postprocessors for binary formats like PDF or EPUB.

A Postprocessor that adds a copyright notice would look like this:

.A Postprocessor that inserts a copyright notice in the footer element
[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/CopyrightFooterPostprocessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> All Preprocessors must extend the class `org.asciidoctor.extension.Postprocessor` and implement the method `process()`.
<2> The processor parses the resulting HTML text using the Jsoup library.
    This returns the document as a data structure.
<3> Find the element with the ID `footer-text`.
    This element contains the footer text, which usually contains the document generation timestamp.
    If this element is available its text is modified by appending the copyright notice.
<4> Finally convert the modified document back to the HTML string and let the processor return it.

To make AsciidoctorJ use our processor it also has to be registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/CopyrightFooterPostprocessorTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The postprocessor is registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry` of the Asciidoctor instance.
<2> To make Asciidoctor generate the footer element the option <<options,`headerFooter`>> must be activated.

[[treeprocessor]]
=== Treeprocessors

A Treeprocessor gets the whole AST and may do whatever it likes with the document tree.
Examples for Treeprocessors could insert blocks, add roles to nodes with a certain content, etc.

Treeprocessors are called by Asciidoctor at the end of the loading process after Preprocessors, Block processors, Macro processors and Include processors but before Postprocessors that are called after the conversion process.

Our example Treeprocessor will recognize paragraphs that contain terminal scripts like below and make listing blocks from them and add the role `terminal` that can be styled in an own way.

.Example AsciiDoc document containing a terminal script
....
include::src/test/resources/treeprocessorcontent.adoc[]
....

As the first line of the second block starts with a `$` sign the whole block should become a listing block.
The result when rendering this document with our Treeprocessor should be the same as if the document looked like this:

....
include::src/test/resources/treeprocessorresult.adoc[]
....

Note that a Blockprocessor would not work for this task, as a Blockprocessor requires a block name for which it is called, but in this case the only way to identify this type of blocks is the beginning of the first line.

The Treeprocessor could look like this:

.A Treeprocessor that processes terminal scripts.
[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/TerminalCommandTreeprocessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Every Treeprocessor must extend `org.asciidoctor.extension.Treeprocessor` and implement the method `process(Document)`.
<2> The implementation basically iterates over the tree and invokes `processBlock()` for every node.
<3> The method `processBlock()` checks for every node if it is a paragraph that has a first line beginning with a `$`.
    If it encounters such a block it replaces it with the block created in the method `convertToTerminalListing()`.
    Otherwise it descends into the AST searching for these blocks.
<4> When creating the new block we reuse the parent of the original block.
    The context of the new block has to be `listing` to get a source block.
    The content can be simply taken from the original block.
    We add the option 'subs' with the value ':specialcharacters' so that special characters are substituted, i.e. `>` and `<` will be replaced with `\&gt;` and `\&lt;` respectively.
<5> Finally we add the role of the node to `terminal`, which will result in the div containing the listing having the class `terminal`.

After that we can simply use that Treeprocessor by registering it at the `JavaExtensionRegistry`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/TerminalCommandTreeprocessorTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The Treeprocessor is registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry` of the Asciidoctor instance.

[[docinfoprocessor]]
=== Docinfo Processors

Docinfo Processors are primarily targeted for the HTML and DocBook5 target format.
A Docinfo Processor basically allows to add content to the HTML header or at the end of the HTML body.
For the DocBook5 target format a Docinfo Processor can add content to the info element or at the very end of the document just before the closing tag of the root element.

Our example Docinfo Processor will add a robots meta tag to the head of the generated HTML document:

.A Docinfo Processor that adds a robots meta tag
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/RobotsDocinfoProcessor.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The Location annotation defines whether the result of this Docinfo Processor should be added to the header or the footer of the document.
    Content is added to the header via `LocationType.HEADER` and to the footer via `LocationType.FOOTER`.
<2> Every Docinfo Processor must extend the class `DocinfoProcessor` and implement the `process()` method.
<3> Our example implementation simply returns the meta tag as a string.

To make AsciidoctorJ use our processor it also has to be registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/RobotsDocinfoProcessorTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The Docinfo Processor implementation is registered at the `JavaExtensionRegistry` of the Asciidoctor instance.
<2> We render our document with header and footer instead of an embeddable document.
    Otherwise there is no header where the doc info can be added to.
<3> Docinfo Processors will only be called by Asciidoctor if the safe mode is at least `SECURE`.
<4> Test via the Jsoup HTML parsing library that our meta tag was correctly added to the resulting document.

[[ExtensionSPI]]
=== Automatically loading extensions

In previous examples, the extensions were registered manually.
However, AsciidoctorJ provides another way to register extensions.
If any implementation of the SPI interface is present on the classpath, it will be executed.

To create an autoloadable extension you should do the next steps:

Create a class that implements `org.asciidoctor.jruby.extension.spi.ExtensionRegistry`.

[source]
.org.asciidoctor.extension.integratorguide.TerminalCommandExtension.java
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/TerminalCommandExtension.java[tags=include-extension-registry]
----
<1> To autoload extensions you need to implement `ExtensionRegistry`.
<2> AsciidoctorJ will automatically run the `register` method. The method is responsible for registering all extensions.
<3> All required Java extensions are registered.

Next, you need to create a file called `org.asciidoctor.jruby.extension.spi.ExtensionRegistry` inside `META-INF/services` with the implementation's full qualified name.

[source]
.META-INF/services/org.asciidoctor.jruby.extension.spi.ExtensionRegistry
----
include::src/test/resources/extensionregistry/META-INF/services/org.asciidoctor.jruby.extension.spi.ExtensionRegistry[]
----

And that's all.
Now when a `.jar` file containing the previous structure is dropped into the classpath of AsciidoctorJ, the `register` method will be executed automatically and the extensions will be registered.

[NOTE]
--
If you have installed AsciidoctorJ as recommended, the asciidoctorj command will be on the path, and you can use:

 asciidoctorj -cp=lib/myextension.jar test.adoc

If you have downloaded the distribution jars only, use a command like:

 java -cp lib/jruby-complete-9.2.7.0.jar;lib/asciidoctor-api-2.0.0.jar;lib/asciidoctor-core-2.0.0.jar;lib/jcommander-1.35.jar;lib/myextension.jar org.asciidoctor.jruby.cli.AsciidoctorInvoker test.adoc
--

== Publish everywhere: Adapt Asciidoctor to your own target format

For output formats that are not natively supported by Asciidoctor it is possible to write an own converter in Java.
To get your own converter that creates string content running in {uri-repo}[AsciidoctorJ] these steps are required:

- Implement the converter as a subclass of `org.asciidoctor.converter.StringConverter`.
  Annotate it as a converter for your target format using the annotation `@org.asciidoctor.converter.ConverterFor`.
- Register the converter at the `ConverterRegistry`.
- Pass the target format name to the `Asciidoctor` instance when rendering a source file.

A basic converter that converts to an own text format looks like this:

[source,java]
.org.asciidoctor.converter.TextConverter.java
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/converter/TextConverter.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The annotation `@ConverterFor` binds the converter to the given target format.
    That means that when this converter is registered and a document should be rendered with the backend name `text` this converter will be used for conversion.
<2> A converter must implement this constructor, because {uri-repo}[AsciidoctorJ] will call the constructor with this signature.
    For every conversion a new instance will be created.
<3> The method `convert()` is called with the AST object for the document, i.e. a `Document` instance, when a document is rendered.
<4> The optional parameter `transform` hints at the transformation to be executed.
    This could be for example the value `embedded` to indicate that the resulting document should be without headers and footers.
    If it is `null` the transformation usually is defined by the node type and name.
<5> Calls to the method `getContent()` of a node will recursively call the method `convert()` with the child nodes again.
    Thereby the converter can collect the rendered child nodes, merge them appropriately and return the rendering of the whole node.

Finally the converter can be registered and used for conversion of AsciiDoc documents:

[source,java,indent=0]
.Use the TextConverter
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/converter/TextConverterTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Registers the converter class `TextConverter` for this Asciidoctor instance.
    The given converter is responsible for converting to the target format `text` because the `@ConverterFor` annotation of the converter class defines this name.
<2> The conversion options `backend` is set to the value `text` so that our `TextConverter` will be used.

Alternatively the converter can be registered automatically once the jar file containing the converter is available on the classpath.
Therefore a service implementation for the interface `org.asciidoctor.converter.spi.ConverterRegistry` has to be in the same jar file.
For the `TextConverter` this implementation could look like this:

[source,java]
.org.asciidoctor.integrationguide.converter.TextConverterRegistry
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/converter/TextConverterRegistry.java[]
----

The jar file must also contain the services file containing the fully qualified class name of the `ConverterRegistry` implementation to make this service implementation available:

.META-INF/services/META-INF/services/org.asciidoctor.jruby.converter.spi.ConverterRegistry
----
include::src/test/resources/converterregistry/META-INF/services/org.asciidoctor.jruby.converter.spi.ConverterRegistry[]
----

To render a document with this converter the target format name `text` has to be passed via the option `backend`.
But note that it is no longer necessary to explicitly register the converter for the target format.

[source,java]
----
File adocFile = ...
asciidoctor.convertFile(adocFile, OptionsBuilder.options().backend("text"));
----

It is also possible to provide converters for binary formats.
In this case the converter should extend the generic class `org.asciidoctor.converter.AbstractConverter<T>` where `T` is the return type of the method `convert()`.
`StringConverter` is actually a concrete subclass for the type `String`.

== Logs handling API

[NOTE]
====
This API is inspired by Java Logging API (JUL).
If you are familiar with `java.util.logging.*` you will see familiar analogies with some of its components.
====

AciidoctorJ (v1.5.7+) offers the possibility to capture messages generated during document rendering.
These messages correspond to logging information and are organized in 6 severity levels:

. DEBUG
. INFO
. WARN
. ERROR
. FATAL
. UNKNOWN

The easiest way to capture messages is registering a `LogHandler` through the `Asciidoctor` instance.

[source,java]
.Registering a LogHandler
----
Asciidoctor asciidoctor = Asciidoctor.Factory.create();

asciidoctor.registerLogHandler(new LogHandler() { // <1>
    @Override
    public void log(LogRecord logRecord) {
        System.out.println(logRecord.getMessage());
    }
});
----
<1> Use `registerLogHandler` to register one or more handlers.

The `log` method in the `org.asciidoctor.log.LogHandler` interface provides a `org.asciidoctor.log.LogRecord` that exposes the following information:

[horizontal]
Severity severity::
Severity level of the current record.

Cursor cursor::
Information about the location of the event, contains:
* LineNumber: relative to the file where the message occurred.
* Path: source file simple name, or `<stdin>` value when rending from a String.
* Dir: absolute path to the source file parent directory, or the execution path when rending from a String.
* File: absolute path to the source file, or `null` when rending from a String. +
These will point to the correct source file, even when this is included from another.

String message::
Descriptive message about the event.

String sourceFileName::
Contains the value `<script>`. +
For the source filename see `Cursor` above.

String sourceMethodName::
The Asciidoctor Ruby engine method used to render the file; `convertFile` or `convert` whether you are rending a File or a String.

=== Log Handling SPI

Similarly to AsciidoctorJ extensions, the Log Handling API provides an alternate method to register Handlers without accessing `Asciidoctor` instance.

Start creating a normal LogHandler implementation.

[source,Java]
----
package my.asciidoctor.log.MemoryLogHandler;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import org.asciidoctor.log.LogHandler;
import org.asciidoctor.log.LogRecord;

/**
 * Stores LogRecords in memory for later analysis.
 */
public class MemoryLogHandler extends LogHandler {

  private List<LogRecord> logRecords = new ArrayList<>();

  @Override
  public void log(LogRecord logRecord) {
    logRecords.add(record);
  }

  public List<LogRecord> getLogRecords() {
    return logRecords;
  }
}
----

Next, create a file called `org.asciidoctor.log.LogHandler` inside `META-INF/services` with the implementation’s full qualified name.

.META-INF/services/org.asciidoctor.log.LogHandler
 my.asciidoctor.log.MemoryLogHandler

And that’s all.
Now when a .jar file containing the previous structure is dropped inside classpath of AsciidoctorJ, the handler will be registered automatically.


== Syntax Highlighter API

Asciidoctor supports a range of different syntax highlighters: Coderay, HighlightJs, Rouge, Pygments and Prettify.
Since version 2.0.0 Asciidoctor also supports to adapt and plug in other syntax highlighters when rendering to HTML.

AsciidoctorJ offers this as well since version 2.1.0.

Adapting a syntax highlighter to Asciidoctor involves a subset of the following tasks:

- Include certain stylesheets and scripts into the resulting HTML document.
- Create stylesheet and script resources in the filesystem in case the document is rendered to a file and it's converted with the attributes ':linkcss' and ':copycss'.
- Format the source block element, by wrapping it into `<pre/>` and `<code/>` elements with certain attributes.
  This means to convert the source text `puts "Hello World"` to the HTML `<pre class="highlightme"><code>puts "Hello World"</code></pre>`.
- Format the source text itself by mapping it to span elements.
  This means to convert the source text `puts "Hello World"` to the HTML `<span class="id">puts</span> <span class="stringliteral">"Hello World"</span>`.
  This result still has to be formatted, which usually means to wrap it in `<pre/>` and `<code/>` elements.

To adapt to a certain syntax highlighter some of these tasks have to be implemented.
The following sections show how to write an adapter for a custom syntax highlighter.

=== Implement a syntax highlighter adapter

A syntax highlighter must implement the interface `org.asciidoctor.syntaxhighlighter.SyntaxHighlighterAdapter`.
This has to be registered at the Asciidoctor instance, so that it can be used by using the corresponding value for the attribute `:source-highlighter`.

A `SyntaxHighlighterAdapter` must implement methods to add stylesheets and scripts to the resulting HTML document.
This is considered as a core functionality that every syntax highlighter requires.

The following example shows a very simplistic syntax highlighter that uses {uri-highlightjs}[highlight.js]:

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/syntaxhighlighter/HighlightJsHighlighter.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Every syntax highlighter must implement the interface `org.asciidoctor.syntaxhighlighter.SyntaxHighlighterAdapter`.
<2> The method `hasDocInfo` indicates that this highlighter only wants to add DocInfo to the footer of the document.
<3> The method `getDocInfo` is only called to return the DocInfo for the footer of the document.
    It returns references to the required css and js sources and starts highlight.js.

Let's say we want to convert this document:

.sources.adoc
[source,adoc]
-----
include::src/test/resources/sources.adoc[]
-----

Now this document can be converted using our highlighter after registering it with Asciidoctor:

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/syntaxhighlighter/HighlightJsHighlighterTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Register the adapter class using a well defined name.
<2> Docinfo is only written if the document is converted with the option `:header_footer`.
<3> The well defined name that was used to register the syntax highlighter must be used in the attribute `:source-highlighter`.


=== Lifecycle of a SyntaxHighlighterAdapter

AsciidoctorJ will create an own instance for every document that it converts.

It will try to instantiate the class by calling a constructor that has three parameters:

`name`::
  The name of the syntax highlighter as it was referenced by the `:source-highlighter` attribute.
  In the previous example this was `"myhighlightjs"`.

`backend`::
  The name of the backend used to convert the document.
  This is for example `"html5"`.
  Note that SyntaxHighlighters can only be used for HTML based backends.

`options`::
  A map containing options for this syntax highlighter.
  Currently this contains the current `org.asciidoctor.ast.Document` for the key `"document"`.

This means the syntax highlighter class could also have this constructor:

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/syntaxhighlighter/threeparams/HighlightJsHighlighter.java[tags=include]
----

A constructor with only the first two, or only the first parameter is also allowed.
AsciidoctorJ will call the constructor with the most matching parameters.

=== Formatting the source block element

{uri-highlightjs}[highlight.js] tries to automatically determine the source language, which might fail or result in wrong matches.
To help highlight.js in identifying the correct source language the `<code/>` element can be annotated with the language as a class.

That means instead of simply wrapping the code in `<pre/>` and `<code/>` elements we want to wrap it inside `<pre>` and `<code class="java"/>`.
To allow Asciidoctor to apply the styles to properly embed a source block inside the document, the `<pre/>` element should also have the class `highlight`.
Therefore we want to wrap the source text inside this construct:

[source,html]
----
<pre class="highlight">
  <code class="java">
    ...
  </code>
</pre>
----

To allow a syntax highlighter to create this construct it also has to implement the interface `org.asciidoctor.syntaxhighlighter.Formatter`:

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/syntaxhighlighter/HighlightJsWithLanguageHighlighter.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The `SyntaxHighlighterAdapter` also has to implement the interface `Formatter`.
    This interface only requires the implementation of the method `format()` that receives the `org.asciidoctor.ast.Block` that is highlighted, the source language, and additional options.
<2> The implementation of `format()` wraps everything in a `<pre/>` and `<code/>` element with the required classes.
    The value for the class of the `<code/>` element is the source language which is passed as an argument to the method.
<3> The source text to be nested into the `<pre/>` and `<code/>` elements has to be obtained using `node.getContent()`.
    This guarantees that further processing like substitutions work properly.

=== Link and copy external resources

In <<syntax-highlighter-adapter>> we have seen how to implement a basic syntax highlighter that embeds all required resources as DocInfo in the document.
When the document is converted with the attributes `:linkcss` and `:copycss` we expect though that these resources are also written to disk next to the document, and that the document only references them.

Looking at our current example of the highlight.js adapter we referenced the resources from the internet.
For scenarios where it should also be possible to read the document while offline, the syntax highlighter can implement the interface `org.asciidoctor.syntaxhighlighter.StylesheetWriter`:

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/syntaxhighlighter/HighlightJsWithOfflineStylesHighlighter.java[tags=include]
----
<1> A syntax highlighter that writes additional resources to the filesystem next to the document must implement the interface `org.asciidoctor.syntaxhighlighter.StylesheetWriter`.
<2> If the document is converted with the attributes `:copycss` and `:linkcss` the DocInfo that is added to the converted document should link to the local resources.
<3> The syntax highlighter should return if it wants to write stylesheets in `isWriteStylesheet()`.
    This method could for example examine the document if it really needs external resources and return the corresponding result.
<4> The method `writeStylesheet()` gets the `org.asciidoctor.ast.Document` and the File for the target directory where the document should be written.
    External resources should be written to this directory as well.

This highlighter writes the css and js resources to files in the same directory as the document if it is converted with the attributes `:linkcss` and `:copycss`:

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/syntaxhighlighter/HighlightJsHighlighterTest.java[tags=includestylesheetwriter]
----
<1> External stylesheets are only written when converting to a file, not when converting to a stream or a string, and when the attributes `:linkcss` and `:copycss` are set.

=== Static syntax highlighting during conversion

The examples we looked at until now did the actual syntax highlighting in the browser.
But there are also cases where it is desirable to highlight the source during conversion, either because the syntax highlighter is implemented in Java, or syntax highlighting should also work when Javascript is not enabled at the client.
The following example uses {uri-prismjs}[prism.js] to show how to achieve this:

When a `SyntaxHighlighterAdapter` also implements the interface `org.asciidoctor.syntaxhighlighter.Highlighter` it will be called to convert the raw source text to HTML.
The example uses {uri-prismjs}[prism.js] which is also a Javascript library.
But now we will call this library during document conversion and only add the css part in the resulting HTML, so that the highlighted source will appear correctly even if Javascript is disabled on the client.

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/syntaxhighlighter/PrismJsHighlighter.java[tags=include]
----
<1> A syntax highlighter that wants to statically convert the source text has to implement the interface `org.asciidoctor.syntaxhighlighter.Highlighter`.
<2> We use the Nashorn Javascript engine to run prism.js.
<3> When rendering to a file and the attributes `:linkcss` and `:copycss` are set the css file of prism.js should be written to disk.
    Otherwise we include the content in a `<style/>` element.
<4> `highlight()` is the only method required by the `Highlighter` interface.
    It gets the node to be converted, the source, the language and additional options.
    Here we invoke the prism.js API to convert the plain source text to static HTML, that uses the classes defined in the css.
    This is returned in a `HighlightResult`.

// TODO: Explain what the index is, I don't fully understand it myself yet.

Then we can use the highlighter just like in the previous examples.
We just have to register it and use the correct value for the attribute `:source-highlighter`:

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/syntaxhighlighter/PrismJsHighlighterTest.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Register our prism.js highlighter and set the attribute `:source-highlighter` to its name to use it.
<2> Test that the source code has been formatted statically to `<span/>` elements.

=== Invocation order

// TODO: Generate content of this chapter by a test
The order of method invocations is:

1. `hasDocInfo(HEADER)`
2. `getDocInfo(HEADER)`
3. `format()`
4. `highlight()`
5. `hasDocInfo(FOOTER)`
6. `getDocInfo(FOOTER)`
7. `isWriteStylesheet()`
8. `writeStylesheet()`
